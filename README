c-siphash - Standalone SipHash Implementation in Standard ISO-C11

ABOUT:
        The c-siphash project is a standalone implementation of SipHash in
        Standard ISO-C11. It provides a streaming-capable API to compute data
        hashes according to the SipHash algorithm.

        To use siphash, include c-siphash.h and link to the libcsiphash.so
        library. A pkg-config entry is provided as well.

        For API documentation, see the c-siphash.h header file, as well as the
        docbook comments for each function.

REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for c-siphash are:

            libc (e.g., glibc >= 2.16)

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.41
            pkg-config >= 0.29

INSTALL:
        The meson build-system is used for c-siphash. Contact upstream
        documentation for detailed help. In most situations the following
        commands are sufficient to build and install c-siphash from source:

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ meson setup . ..
            $ ninja
            $ ninja test
            # ninja install

        No custom configuration options are available.
